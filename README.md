# M.A.S.E - Mac Auto Startup Editor
Apple Silicon laptops are set up to automatically turn on when the lid is opened and when the power is connected. This might not be the ideal behavior for some users. Apple [introduced a method](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120622) to disable/modify this behavior starting with macOS Sequoia 15. This app is a wrapper for for these commands.

## Requirements
 1. Apple Silicon laptop running macOS Sequoia 15 or later.  
 2. Sudo access.
